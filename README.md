Starling-Filters
================

Some basic (mostly distortion) FragmentFilters for use with Starling.

Note: So far most values are delta values based on the DisplayObject's width. Those filters are still work under progress, so that may change soon.

Especially the Matrix3DFilter is just experimental. I wouldn't recommend using it, as it is.

For now the package contains:
- DiamondFilter
- DrainFilter
- EdgesFilter
- EmbossFilter
- Matrix3DFilter
- PolarFilter
- SpherizeFilter
- Whirlfilter

I'm sorry about the poor naming, and open for better suggestions. ;)


live demo
=========
I've build a simple (cirrus) webcam chat with Starling as demo project for my extensions.
Besides the Video/WebcamVideo extensions, it includes presets of my filters, just like some of the ones created by Devon O. Wolfgang (https://github.com/devon-o/Starling-Filters)

I'll add a link soon.
